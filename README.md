Recent years, deep learning has obtained remarkable achievements in many fields, including computer vision, speech recognition and natural language processing. As for image classification, convolutional neural network (CNN) has outperformed traditional machine learning models and even produced results in some cases superior to human recognition. There are a lot of news and blogs telling about them and I was told that deep neural networks are designed to extract features automatically and offer an end to end architecture, directly connect raw data and goal. In this report, I make a series experiments to confirm the statement by comparing traditional machine learning models with features extracted from raw data by expanding pixels, principal component analysis and histogram of oriented Gradient with convolutional neural network with raw data.
